    "DCI or Distributed CI is a continuous integration project that aims to bring external teams inside an existing CI\n",
    "framework. This by running CI on dedicated lab environments that are running in their data centers with their configurations and their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "DCI is base on a client/server model. The remote labs are the clients, the server centralize the jobs and collects the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this article is to give swift insight of how anyone can query the DCI control server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a Python virtual environment to install our DCI client library.\n",

    "    $ pip install dciclient\n",

    "You now need to load our dcirc file to be authenticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ . dcirc.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to validate everything is working properly is to list your remotecis:\n",
